This is the newer update because I have uploaded the custom wildfly romenext app image to docker hub. There is no need to rebuild the image as describe in the folder "wildfly_docker_workspace". Use these instructions instead of those in "wildfly_docker_workspace".

Step 1:
Login docker hub from your terminal: 

sudo docker login --username emptylot --password superman009725

Step 2: sudo docker pull emptylot/romenext_rev3:latest

Step 3: sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name romenext_app_rev3 emptylot/romenext_rev3:latest

Step 4: sudo docker inspect romenext_app_rev3 
(This command is to get the ip address of the container. You can find the container ip in Networks { "IPAddress"}.)

Step 5: Navigate to browser and access the romenext application using:
{your ip address}:8080/admin or {your ip address}:8080/webguiportal


Updates:

There might be a problem to directly use the container ip in browser for Windows. The application can only get the container ip dynamically from session data.
I might need your machine ip to rebuild the image to work on your machine. In this case, use the following instructions instead after Step 2.

Step 3: sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name romenext_app_rev3 emptylot/romenext_rev3:yourname

Step 4: Get your machine ip address (IPv4 Address (check by ipconfig in Windows CMD))

Step 5: Navigate to browser and access the romenext application using:
{your machine ip address}:8080/admin or {your machine ip address}:8080/webguiportal

Step 6: The default username and password for {your machine ip address}:8080/admin is:
username: ra4
password: superman4

You can set up the user credentials to login {your machine ip address}:8080/webguiportal in {your machine ip address}:8080/admin.
